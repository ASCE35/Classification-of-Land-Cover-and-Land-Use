This folder stores the code implementation of the [*ViT*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) model and the corresponding experimental results of land use and land cover classification, as a comparison model for the Swin Transformer algorithm used in this work.

## Method:
![alt](/data/ViT.png "Figure 1.  The architecture of the ViT.")
<br/>
From the model architecture diagram of ViT we can see that ViT contains 3 main parts:


## Results:
Below shows the graph of accuracy and loss against epochs for both training and testing data. And the model was trained for 20 epochs.
