This folder stores the code implementation of the [*ViT*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) model and the corresponding experimental results of land use and land cover classification, as a comparison model for the Swin Transformer algorithm used in this work.

## Method:
Below shows the graph of accuracy and loss against epochs for both training and testing data. And the model was trained for 20 epochs.

## Results:
