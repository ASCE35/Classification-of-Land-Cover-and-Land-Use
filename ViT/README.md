This folder stores the code implementation of the ViT model and the corresponding experimental results of land use and land cover classification, as a comparison model for the Swin Transformer algorithm used in this work.

## Method:
Below shows the graph of accuracy and loss against epochs for both training and testing data. And the model was trained for 20 epochs.

## Results:
