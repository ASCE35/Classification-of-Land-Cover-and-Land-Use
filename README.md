# Classification-of-Land-Cover-and-Land-Use
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and necessary Python scripts that demonstrate the application of a deep learning image classification algorithm named Swin Transformer for the classification of satellite imagery data. <br/>

**For implementation:**
* Dataset can be downloaded from the link [*here*](https://github.com/phelber/eurosat?tab=readme-ov-file).
* Run the notebook to sequentially install the required packages, configure the experimental environment, and train the model.

## The problem to be tacke:
Utilizing satellite imagery for land cover and land use classification plays a crucial role and holds significant meaning in fields such as environmental management, land planning, agricultural development, and natural resource conservation. However, the spatial distribution of different land cover types is complex, making the improvement of classification accuracy a challenging task. With the continuous development of computing power and deep learning, image classification networks based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) and Transformers have been extensively researched and applied. Therefore, this work aims to employ deep learning techniques, particularly by integrating the strengths of both CNNs and Transformer networks, to achieve precise classification of land cover and land use. <br/>
