# Classification-of-Land-Cover-and-Land-Use
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks and necessary Python scripts that demonstrate the application of a deep learning image classification algorithm named Swin Transformer for the classification of satellite imagery data. <br/>

** For implementation: **
* Dataset can be downloaded from the link [*here*](https://github.com/phelber/eurosat?tab=readme-ov-file).
* Run the notebook to sequentially install the required packages, configure the experimental environment, and train the model.
